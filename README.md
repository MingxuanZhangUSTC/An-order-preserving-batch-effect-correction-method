An order-preserving batch-effect correction method
Single-cell RNA sequencing has significantly advanced our understanding of
 cell heterogeneity and gene regulation. Batch-effect correction is essential for
 achieving robust data integration. Multiple methods have been developed to
 address this issue, particularly procedural approaches involving components such
 as anchoring or deep learning, which have achieved notable successes. How
ever, order preservation, as an important feature, has been largely overlooked
 in procedural methods. Based on a monotonic deep learning network, we devel
oped a correction method with order-preserving feature. By comparing with
 existing methods, we demonstrated that our method effectively improved cluster
ing performance, better retained original inter-gene correlation and differential
 expression information
